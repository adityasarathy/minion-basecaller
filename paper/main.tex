\begin{abstract}
    The MinION device by Oxford Nanopore is the first portable sequencing device. MinION is able to produce very long reads (reads over 100 kBp were reported), however it suffers from high sequencing error rate. In this paper, we show novel model reducing the error rate can be reduced by improving the base calling process on 1D reads using gated residual convolutional neural networks (CNN) combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) learning approach.

    Whole process is trainned end-to-end from raw signal on R9 sequecing pore and once trainned it's independent from Metrichor.

\chapter{Introduction}

In this paper, we introduce the base caller for the MinION nanopore sequencing platform~\cite{mikheyev2014first}.The MinION device by Oxford Nanopore, weighing only 90 grams, is currently the smallest high-throughput DNA sequencer. Thanks to its low capital costs, small size and the possibility of analyzing the data in real time as they are produced, MinION is very promising for clinical applications, such as monitoring infectious disease outbreaks~\cite{judge2015early}\cite{quick2016real}, characterizing structural variants in cancer\cite{norris2016nanopore} and even full human genome assembly~\cite{jain2017nanopore}.

Although MinION is able to produce long reads, they have a high sequencing error rate. This has been somewhat aleviated with new R9 pore model, replacing older R7 ones. In this paper, we show that this error rate can be reduced by replacing the default base caller provided by the manufacturer with a properly trained neural network model.

In the MinION device, single-stranded DNA fragments move through nanopores, which causes drops in the electric current. The electric current is measured at each pore several thousand times per second. The electric current depends mostly on the context of several DNA bases passing through the pore at the time of measurement. As the DNA moves through the pore, the context shifts and the electric current changes.

A MinION device typically yields reads several thousand bases long; reads as long as 100,000 bp have been reported. 1D read have usually error rate about   30\%. After parameter training, base calling can be performed by running the Viterbi algorithm, which will result in the sequence of states with the highest likelihood.

\chapter{Background}

\section{Sequencing overview}
Informally, the MinION sequencer works as follows. First, DNA is sheared into fragments of 8–20 kbp and adapters are ligated to either end of the fragments. The resulting DNA fragments pass through a protein embedded in a membrane via a nanometre-sized channel (this protein is the `nanopore'). A single strand of DNA passes through the pore; the optional use of a hairpin adapter at one end of the fragment allows the two strands of DNA to serially pass through nanopore, allowing two measurements of the fragment. With hairpin it's called 2D read, which isn't topic of this paper. In here we focus only on 1D reads.

In ONT terminology, the first strand going through the nanopore is the template, and the second is the complement. As a DNA strand passes through the pore it partially blocks the flow of electric current through the pore. The flow of current is sampled over time which is the observable output of the system. The central idea is that the single-stranded DNA product present in the nanopore affects the current in a way that is strong enough to enable decoding the electric signal data into a DNA sequence. This process, called basecalling, takes as input a list of current measurements, and produces as output a list of DNA bases most likely to have generated those currents.

The nanopore is 6 nucleoides wide, and eariler HMM based models model it as such.

\section{Basecalling}

The core of the decoding process is the basecalling step. Official basecaller is Metrichor, previously perfomed in the cloud before being opensourced under name Nanonet.

Earlier models were (Hidden markov model) HMM based where hidden state modeled DNA sequence of length 6 (6-mer) in the nanopore. Pore models were used in computing emission probabilities.~\cite{loman2015complete,schreiber2015analysis,szalay2015novo,timp2012dna} and the recest open source HMM based basecaller Nanocall~\cite{david2016nanocall}.

Recent models opted using (Recurrent neural network) RNN, notably DeepNano~\cite{deepnano} and recently open sourced official Nanonets from ONT.
